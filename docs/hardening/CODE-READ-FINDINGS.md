## Dataset

### Backend

- **Universal P0**: zero meaningful unit / integration / e2e tests
  exist for the dataset module today. Skeleton specs only.
- `src/modules/datasets/controllers/addDataset.ts:100` (also
  `updateDataset.ts:112`, `validateDatasetField.ts:98`)
  — column names extracted from result set are interpolated into
  `pg_typeof("${col}")::text` without identifier escaping. **P1**
  (low risk for trusted datasources; defensible regardless).
- `src/modules/datasets/controllers/listDataset.ts:53–58` (same
  pattern in `addDataset.ts`, `updateDataset.ts`,
  `validateDatasetField.ts`) — "load all datasources for the org,
  then `.find()` in memory" repeated in 4 places. **P2**.
- `src/modules/datasets/controllers/addDataset.ts:178` — BE response
  wraps in `{ savedDataset }`, FE service consumes `res.data` as the
  whole object (`dataset.service.ts:152`). Contract drift. **P2**.
- `pg_typeof()` is Postgres-only — MySQL / Oracle silently fail with
  unknown column types. **P2**.

### Database

- `src/shared/db/index.ts` — `synchronize: true`, no migrations. **P2**
  (works for now, will hurt at scale).
- `src/shared/db/shared_entity/dataset.entity.ts:18–93` — clean schema
  with proper soft-delete (`@DeleteDateColumn`, `@VersionColumn`).
  Indices on `(organisationId, datasourceId)` and
  `(datasourceId, status)`. Audit columns deselected — **good**.
- `src/shared/db/shared_entity/datasetField.entity.ts:14–83` —
  `customLogic` typed as `text` (avoids varchar truncation). Cascade on
  analysis FK is hard-delete by design.

### Frontend

- `src/app/modules/dataset/services/dataset.service.ts:27–290` —
  signals typed `any[]`, `any`. Every HTTP method
  destructures `res: any`. **P1**.
- `add-dataset.component.ts` (~1000 lines) — template-driven forms;
  inconsistent with reactive-forms pattern used elsewhere. **P2**.
- No live preview when editing custom-field formula. **P2**.

### Things that look genuinely good

- Audit logging on every CUD.
- Soft-delete cascade helper (`cascadeSoftDelete`) covers the full
  graph.
- Cross-org isolation: every dataset lookup filters on `organisationId`,
  source of truth is JWT.
- Custom-field topological sort: dependencies evaluate in order,
  formula errors degrade to `null` per row instead of crashing.
- Connection lifecycle: every controller that opens a datasource
  connection destroys it in `finally`.

## Analysis & Visual Builder

### Backend

- `src/shared/db/shared_entity/visual_config.entity.ts:49` —
  `config: any` (jsonb). No schema validation on save. **P1**.
- `src/shared/db/shared_entity/analysis_filter.entity.ts:41–49` —
  `config: any` (jsonb), plus a `categoryValues` column with TODO
  comment that nothing writes to. **P1**.
- `src/modules/analyses/controllers/runAnalysisQuery.ts:138–142`
  — RLS integration is correctly wired through `resolveRlsFilters`.
  **Good**.
- `runAnalysisQuery.ts:146–148` — no schema validation of the filter
  payload received from FE. A malformed filter crashes the query
  builder downstream. **P1**.
- `runAnalysisQuery.ts` — no audit on analysis-run. **P3**
  (compliance ask, not security).
- `src/modules/analysis-filters/controllers/addAnalysisFilter.ts:79–88`
  — `validateFilterDefaults()` is best-effort post-save; warns about
  stale defaults but doesn't block. **OK**.
- `src/modules/visuals/visuals.routes.ts:1–41` — only one GET route;
  no create/update/delete endpoints for visuals exposed. They live
  inside the analysis save path. **OK**.
- No parameters table or CRUD; the analysis_parameter gap blocks
  snapshot-stable dashboards. **P0** (gap-list addition pulled in).

### Database

- Soft-delete inconsistency: `Analyses` and `AnalysisFilter` have
  `@DeleteDateColumn`; `Visual` and `VisualConfig` do not. **P2**.
- Denormalised `org/datasource/dataset` names on `AnalysisFilter`
  (`analysis_filter.entity.ts:85–95`) — risk of drift after rename. **P2**.

### Frontend

- `src/app/modules/analyses/constants/charts.constants.ts` —
  **86** chart types defined, not 73 as docs claim. **P2**.
- `src/app/modules/analyses/components/visual-config-sidebar/*` —
  procedural per-chart `*ngIf`s instead of declarative VisualSpec.
  This is the substrate for the existing
  `plans/harmonic-strolling-peach.md` property-verification plan. **P1**.
- `src/app/shared/helpers/echarts-option-builder.ts:61–66` —
  emphasis builder explicitly stamps `scale` as boolean to defuse
  merge-leak. **Good** (regression test would be ideal).
- `src/app/modules/analyses/components/edit-analyses/edit-analyses.component.ts`
  (2474 lines) — uses signals + NgRx; detects stale column refs at
  1274–1275 when dataset columns disappear. Defensive. **Good**.

### Seams

- `AppliedFilter` shape consistent BE↔FE.
- VisualConfig.config — both sides `any`. **P1**.

### Tests

- Three skeleton component specs only.
- No FE service tests.
- No BE unit/integration tests for analysis controllers.

### Things that look genuinely good

- RLS enforcement on `runAnalysisQuery` is correct and non-bypassable.
- Filter-engine column-name validation
  (`/^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$/`) plus parameterised values — strong.
- Stale-default detection on analysis-filter save.
- Custom-field topological dependency ordering reused from Dataset.

## Dashboard

### Backend

- **P0 (production hardening) — no statement timeout enforced on
  dashboard query execution** (`runDashboardQuery.ts:200`). A
  malicious or pathological SQL hangs the request indefinitely. **P0**.
- `src/modules/dashboards/controllers/getDistinctDashboardFieldValues.ts:195`
  — for custom-field distinct values, loads the full result set,
  enriches in memory, then paginates. Memory-bomb on large datasets. **P1**.
- `src/modules/dashboards/controllers/publishDashboard.ts:88–93`
  — wraps publish in a transaction, reloads target inside for the
  existing-mode safety check. **Good**.
- `publishDashboard.ts:140–144` — calls `snapshotAnalysisIntoDashboard`
  for atomic wipe + write. Idempotent. **Good**.
- `publishDashboard.ts:101–108` — existing-mode publish _wipes
  visuals_. Renaming a dashboard triggers republish, which
  destructively rewrites the snapshot. UX trap. **P1**.
- `snapshotAnalysisIntoDashboard.helper.ts:165–208` — solid
  remapping of field IDs across the snapshot boundary, including
  pruning relations whose endpoints didn't survive.
- `runDashboardQuery.ts:177–195` — RLS applied at query time, not
  at publish time. Intentional per design. **Good**.
- `renderDashboard.ts:54–62` — no logging when `visualConfig` comes
  back null; silent missing relation. **P2**.

### Database

- Soft-delete cascade via FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` on every dashboard
  child (`dashboardVisual.entity.ts:34` etc.). **Good**.
- Confusing entity-level `cascade: false` on Dashboard relations
  (`dashboard.entity.ts:128–135`) while DB-level cascades exist.
  Misleading. **P3**.
- Dead columns `datasetSql` and `datasetName` on Dashboard kept as
  empty strings for back-compat (`dashboard.entity.ts:82–99`). **P3**.
- `DashboardVisualConfig` over-indexed: 3 overlapping indices. **P3**.

### Frontend

- `src/app/modules/dashboards/services/dashboard.service.ts:1–257`
  — signal split between `_loading`, `_saving`, `_rendering` is the
  right call. **Good**.
- `view-dashboard.component.ts:379–382` — missing visual fields
  produce blank chart with no banner. **P1**.
- `view-dashboard.component.ts` — `dashboard: any`, `rawData: any`,
  `filters: any`. **P1**.
- Race-safe rendering via `currentQueryId` monotonic counter
  (`view-dashboard.component.ts:106`). **Good**.
- No explicit mobile layout (auto-stack). **P2**.

### Seams

- Snapshot payload contract stable, but every field on it typed
  `any`. **P1**.
- `visualConfig.config` typed `any` on both sides — same root issue
  as Analysis Track. **P1**.
- Source-analysis deletion creates "zombie dashboard" if loaded
  card opens after deletion. **P2**.

### Tests

- One Playwright spec (`login-dashboard.spec.ts`) covering login →
  navigate to dashboard. **No CRUD / publish / render / filter
  tests.**

### Things that look genuinely good

- Snapshot model transactional and atomic.
- Hybrid live-dataset SQL inside a frozen-layout snapshot is a clean
  design choice.
- Source-analysis innerJoin guards on list endpoint prevent zombies
  from appearing.
- Filter merge at render time excludes disabled filters at DB layer.
- Audit logging on publish includes snapshot counts.

## RLS & Column Security

### Backend (critical layer)

- **P0** — `src/shared/services/rlsResolver.service.ts:46` —
  `if (allRules.length === 0) return [];` Allow-by-default. A user
  with zero rules on a dataset sees every row. **Data exposure.**
- **P1** — `rlsResolver.service.ts:82` — operator hard-mapped:
  `entry.operator === 'NOT_IN' ? 'DOES_NOT_EQUAL' : 'EQUALS'`. A
  BETWEEN rule silently becomes an EQUALS filter. Numeric / date
  ranges not enforced. **Logic bypass.**
- **P2** — `modules/queries/controllers/executeQuery.ts:50` and
  `modules/datasources/controllers/runQuery.ts:29` — ad-hoc query
  endpoints execute raw SQL **without** invoking `resolveRlsFilters`.
  Anyone with the query-execute permission bypasses RLS. Privilege
  escalation (admin scope required, but real).
- **P2** — `rlsResolver.service.ts:25–28` — `UserGroupMapping.find()`
  re-runs per query, no caching.
- **P3** — `rlsResolver.service.ts:54 vs 80` — column name
  lower-cased for grouping but original case passed downstream.
  Silent rule loss on case-sensitive databases.
- **P3** — only rule edits are audited; rule _application_ (which
  rules fired for which query) is not.

### Filter compiler (the safeguard layer)

- `shared/services/filterEngine.service.ts:41–48` — column-name
  validation via `/^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$/`. **Good**.
- Filter values parameterised throughout. No string interpolation.
  **Good**.

### Database

- `src/shared/db/shared_entity/rls_rule.entity.ts` — indices on
  `(datasetId)`, `(organisationId, datasetId)`, `(scope, scopeId)`.
  Soft-delete via `@DeleteDateColumn`. JSONB `values`. Operator
  enum-validated at schema layer.
- No column_security entity. **P0** (gap-list addition pulled in).

### Frontend

- `src/app/modules/rls-rules/components/add-rls-rule.component.ts:71–76`
  — operator dropdown matches BE enum exactly. **Good**.
- Form validation via shared Zod schemas. **Good**.
- No "test-as-user" UI. **P2** (gap addition pulled in).

### Tests

- Zero tests for `rlsResolver`.
- Zero tests for compiled-SQL snapshots.
- No Playwright leak-hunt suite.

### Things that look genuinely good

- Parameterised SQL throughout.
- Cross-org isolation at every lookup.
- Operator enum strictly validated at schema gate.
- Consistent integration on analysis + dashboard query paths.

## Universal observations (apply to all four modules)

1. **No real tests anywhere.** Every track must build its own
   regression suite as part of the work.
2. **`any` typing** on FE services across the board. Every track
   exports the Zod-inferred type from the validators package and
   consumes it on FE.
3. **No statement timeout** on shared-DB pools used for user queries.
   This is the single fastest production hardening win.
4. **`config` JSONB columns** (visual, filter, dashboard-filter,
   dashboard-visual-config) are untyped. They're the substrate of
   "set a property → save → reload → property gone" bugs.
5. **Soft-delete cascade** isn't centrally registered. Each module
   has its own cascade helper. The plan lifts the registry from
   BE-implementation § 0.6 to harmonise.
6. **Audit-log coverage** is good on edits but absent on reads. For
   compliance-conscious customers this is a gap.
7. **Feature flags** exist as a planned construct but no service
   yet. The plan ships one in Week 0.
